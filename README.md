# Tailwind CSS Playground

A simple starter project for playing around with Tailwind in a proper PostCSS environment.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:tailwindcss/playground tailwindcss-playground
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run serve

    # Using Yarn
    yarn run serve
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

4. Open `index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!
